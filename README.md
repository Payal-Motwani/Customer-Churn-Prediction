# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer churn (also known as customer attrition) occurs when a customer stop using a company's products or services. Customer churn affects profitability, especially in industries where revenues are heavily dependent on subscriptions. It is estimated that acquiring a new customer can cost up to five times more than retaining an existing one. Therefore, customer churn analysis is essential as it can help a business identify problems in its services and make correct strategic decisions that would lead to higher customer satisfaction
The goal of this project is to understand and predict customer churn for a bank which is a classification task. We will initially perform exploratory data analysis to identify and visualize the factors contributing to customer churn. This analysis will later help us build a predictive model to understand whether the customer will churn or not.
